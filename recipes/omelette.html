    <h3>The Perfect Omelette</h3>
    <h5>Wondering how to make an omelette that’s pillowy, perfectly folded, and has just the right amount of filling? Well, trust me when I say this is a simple,
        no-fuss method that works every time.
        And if you need some filling ideas – I’ve got several delicious options that’ll please breakfast enthusiasts.</h5>
    <h3>Ingredient List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbs oil, to coat pan</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2oz cheese filling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute the filling. Before you actually make the omelette,
            you’ll need to saute your choice of filling (I’ve listed out options below). Then set the filling aside on a separate plate.</li>
        <li>Make the egg base. Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper in a medium bowl until lightly fluffy.
            And if you’re wondering why you should salt beforehand – I’ve got a quick explanation down below!</li>
        <li>Cook the omelette base. The key to the perfect omelette is cooking low and slow! So heat the oil or butter over medium-low heat,
            then pour the egg mixture into an even layer. Turn the heat to low, and let it cook without poking or prodding for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in the good stuff. Pile the filling onto one side of the omelette.
            Then gently fold the other half over and slowly slide the omelette onto a plate. Breakfast is served!
        </li>
    </ol>
