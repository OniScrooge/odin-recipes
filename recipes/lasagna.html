    <h3>Meghan Splawn's after-Thanksgiving lasagna</h3>
    <h5>When you’ve had your fill of turkey sandwiches and turkey soup, but there are still leftovers waiting to be eaten in the fridge,
        choose greatness. And by greatness we mean a towering lasagna filled with layers of roasted Brussel sprouts, creamy sweet potatoes,
        Thanksgiving stuffing, and of course, the turkey. One might even argue that this next-day meal is even better than the main event itself.</h5>
    <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh herbs, such as thyme or sage</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups turkey gravy, divided</li>
        <li>1 (10-ounce) package no-boil or oven-ready lasagna noodles, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups leftover sweet potato casserole or mashed potatoes, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded, cooked Brussels sprouts, divided</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked, shredded turkey, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups dressing or stuffing</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the baking dish. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375°F.
            Coat a 9x13-inch baking dish (glass or ceramic) with cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the cranberry-ricotta sauce. Place the ricotta, cranberry sauce, egg, salt, and herbs in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna. Spread 1/2 cup of the gravy in a thin layer on the bottom of the baking dish. Top evenly with 1/3 of the noodles,
            1/2 of the potatoes, 1/2 of the Brussels sprouts, 1/2 of the turkey, and 1/3 of the ricotta mixture. Repeat layering with 1/3 of the noodles,
            1/2 cup of the gravy, the remaining potatoes, remaining Brussels sprouts, remaining turkey, and 1/3 of the ricotta mixture.
            Finish with the remaining noodles.</li>
        <li>Top. Top the final layer of noodles with the remaining gravy. Spread the remaining ricotta in a thin, even layer over the gravy.
            Top with the dressing or stuffing in a even layer.</li>
        <li>Bake. Bake until the noodles are tender, the top is golden-brown, and the gravy is bubbling, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool. Cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
